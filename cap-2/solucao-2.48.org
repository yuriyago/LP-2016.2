A directed line segment in the plane can be represented as a pair of
vectors -- the vector running from the origin to the start-point of
the segment, and the vector running from the origin to the end-point
of the segment. Use your vector representation from exercise 2.46 to
define a representation for segments with a constructor make-segment
and selectors start-segment and end-segment.

* Constructor

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
 (define (make-segment vect-1 vect-2) (cons vect-1 vect-2))
#+END_SRC

* Selectors

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
 (define (start-segment segment) (car segment))
 (define (end-segment segment) (cdr segment))
#+END_SRC
