#+Title: Exercício 1.44

* Enunciado

 The idea of smoothing a function is an important concept in signal processing. If f is a function
 and dx is some small number,then the smoothed version of f is the function whose value at a point
 x is the average of f (x− dx), f (x),and f (x+dx). Write a  procedure =smooth= that takes as input
 a procedure that computes f and returns a procedure that computes the smoothed f. It is sometimes
 valuable to repeatedly smooth a function (that is, smooth the smoothed function, and soon) to obtain 
 the n-folds moothed function. Show how to generate the n-fold smoothed function of any given function
 using =smooth= and =repeated= from Exercise 1.43.
